Each "bit" in the list is a NODE

Each NODE has attributes:
  - Data/Value
  - Left  Neighbor Address
  - Right Neighbor Address
  - ___Address/Index___

2 potential approaches

1. Indices
  Pro: Faster finding the next place for the bit to move to
  Con: Have to move every single bit along the path over a spot

2. Neighbors
  Pro:  Faster moves
  Cons: Takes longer to find the next place for the bit to move to
