Brainstorming pt2:

Finding voids:
  - Not sure how to do this. Because their could be overhanging borders on the object's surface, I can't look out in the straight line to find edges
  - For this reason, I am searching from block to block

Finding Surface Area:
- traverse from one cube to all others
- Travel along all neighboring cubes for which there exists some empty space on its border
  - if neighbor cell does not border empty space, then it is landlocked and not actually on Surface
- Once I have all the blocks on the surface, I can get their surface areas
  - Avoid the edge case where the cornering blocks are diagonal neighbors, and they trap (an) empty space(s) where air can't reach
  - I will process this later when I am processing surface area for the surface blocks
