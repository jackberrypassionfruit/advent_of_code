instead of python lists for each monkey...
...one list for all the idems
- items will be processed as they come, in order
- getting to the end of the list will mean I've finished a round
- benefit: less list and object overhead, just in-place mding values

monkey #0: 71962
monkey #1: 71948
monkey #2: 71932
monkey #3: 58
monkey #4: 83
monkey #5: 71974
monkey #6: 55
monkey #7: 71988
